## How it works

The circuit processes 8-bit input data through a series of NOT gates and routes the results to both internal processing and external display. Here's the signal flow:

**Input Processing:**

- 8-bit DIP switch (sw1) provides parallel input data
- Each switch connects to external inputs (EXTIN0-EXTIN7) on the TinyTapeout input block
- Switches are pulled high when closed, creating active-high logic

**Logic Processing:**

- Four NOT gates (not1-not4) invert the first four input bits
- Inverted signals connect to outputs OUT0-OUT3
- Remaining inputs (IN4-IN7) pass directly through to outputs OUT4-OUT7

**Clock and Control:**

- Clock generator (10kHz) provides system timing
- Slide switch (sw2) enables/disables clock signal
- Step button (btn1) allows manual clock stepping for debugging
- Reset button (btn2) with pull-up resistor provides system reset

**Output Display:**

- 7-segment display shows processed data
- External outputs EXTOUT0-EXTOUT6 drive segments A-G
- EXTOUT7 drives decimal point
- Common cathode configuration with ground connection

## How to test

**Basic Functionality Test:**

1. Set all DIP switches to OFF position initially
2. Power on the circuit - 7-segment display should show "0"
3. Toggle individual DIP switches and observe display changes
4. Verify that the first 4 bits are inverted in the output

**Clock Control Test:**

1. Set slide switch (sw2) to enable clock mode
2. Observe automatic updates on the 7-segment display
3. Switch to manual mode and use step button for single-step operation
4. Verify timing with 10kHz clock frequency

**Reset Test:**

1. Configure switches to create a known pattern
2. Press reset button (btn2)
3. Verify system returns to initial state
4. Test reset functionality in both clock modes

**Input/Output Verification:**

- Test each DIP switch individually
- Verify NOT gate operation on bits 0-3
- Confirm direct pass-through on bits 4-7
- Check 7-segment display correspondence

## External hardware

**Required Components:**

- **8-position DIP switch**: Provides 8-bit parallel input data
- **7-segment display (common cathode)**: Shows processed output data
- **Clock generator**: 10kHz frequency source for automatic operation
- **Slide switch**: Clock mode selection (auto/manual)
- **Push buttons (2x)**: Step control and system reset
- **Pull-up resistor**: 1kÎ© for reset button
- **Power supplies**: VCC and GND connections

**Pin Connections:**

- **External Inputs (EXTIN0-7)**: Connect to DIP switch outputs
- **External Clock (EXTCLK)**: Connect to clock control circuit
- **External Reset (EXTRST_N)**: Connect to reset button with pull-up
- **External Outputs (EXTOUT0-7)**: Connect to 7-segment display

**Interface Specifications:**

- **Logic levels**: Standard TTL/CMOS (0V/3.3V or 0V/5V)
- **Current requirements**: Standard digital logic levels
- **Clock frequency**: Up to 10kHz (configurable)
- **Reset**: Active-low with pull-up resistor

**Physical Setup:**

1. Mount DIP switch for easy access to all 8 positions
2. Position 7-segment display for clear visibility
3. Place control buttons (step/reset) in accessible locations
4. Ensure proper power distribution to all components
5. Verify ground connections for 7-segment display common cathode

**Testing Equipment:**

- Logic analyzer or oscilloscope for signal verification
- Multimeter for power supply and continuity checks
- Function generator (optional) for alternative clock sources
